# 11ty Starter

Very simple 11ty starter site with some Nunjuck macros pretending to be components. Some _mildly_ opinionated style rules but pretty basic.

## First steps

**IMPORTANT** Update the repository.URL in `package.json` to point to your newly created one.

Update the name and description in `package.json` and `site.json`.

## Running

> npm start
